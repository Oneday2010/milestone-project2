## Deployment
---
1)Firstly I create the account part of my CSS course on code institute. After practicing mini project, I could get idea to use Gitpod as well as GitHub. I created new repository to start my project and put name as “milestone-project1”

2)After get my own repository for my project I start work all coding and update all my files on Gitpod. 

3)Gitpod, a cloud-based version control software or IDE was used to write all code for this project. 

4)Each day when I done, I save the data and when all the work was done, I went to Github pages and check the setting menu and found the Github pages. I selected the Master Branch and it automatically create URL address. 

5)To access the code,, I can get clone which provides an URL and I can use my phone or any device, or download as zip file on the device.  -
