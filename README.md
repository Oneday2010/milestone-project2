## Overview
---
There are plenty of cafe reviews websites online and many of them gives to user good information. While there are many cafe reviews out there, and the aim of  icoffetmap was all about creating a platform that keeps the visitor interested, wanting to play more with small quiz and get more niched and customised information. Sometime too much information can created chaotic to make decision and take more time also gives less reliable about information. Icoffetmap offer that easy and fast as well as more honest and detailed cafe reviews and information to user. 

## Description

### Strategy
---

 Main target user : cafe searcher/business owner/tourist/visiter


This cafe review website is aimed to attract all demographics with a keen interest in searching nice cafe in Dublin. Especially, website purpose to make right visits experience on cafes base on information and reviews updated. It will also beneficial for  local people  as well as tourists too. In fact, cafe review isn’t popular as much as restaurant review does. However, there are more demand on cafe business as coffee Industry grew massively. Therefore, icoffeemap will give fresh idea and information not only cafe visitor but also, cafe owners too as website will offer more deeper review and customised information.  

####  Business Goals

 2. To provide a professional , clear and easy to navigate website for any type of user, be it first time user as well

 3. Offer customise and niche cafe review information with unique style, better user experience with more interactive functions on website. 

 4. Main business goal will be increase website traffic as user’s cafe reviews tool. It will help local cafe business and visiter experience.  Moreover there are many potential offer can be created such as introduce new cafes, increase area as well as producing goods in related coffee.

#### User Stories

As as First Time User:

“ There are so many cafes in my area, I don’t have time and money to check all the place, I want to find right cafe for me when I need to grab a nice cup of coffee”

“ As crazy coffee lover, I want to find right cafe where serves  good coffee  and unique taste and new experience.”

“ I don’t know about coffee but I love to having nice brunch with my family on my weekend. I want to find nice cafe with food and good space to enjoy my weekend.”

“ This recommended cafe list need to get updates in my area as there are new cafes open recently. As long as there are more cafes I can search I’ll return.”

“ I love coffee and cafes but not sure I know about coffee well.”

### Scope
---

 - Useful - This website is useful to a user who search niche and customise cafe review

 - Sellable - There are many potential fundable possibility such as partnership with other cafe reviews, introducing new cafe goods ( coffee beans/ cafe goods in one platform etc)

 - Buildable - Fits in with the level of my abilities, limited Javascript function but it can improve in future. 

 - Objective - find best desired cafe in short time with deeper details

 - Functional - user can find the information from TOP3 pages as well as all the cafe image can give certain idea of each cafes, all the image linked with detailed review. 

 - Non-Functional  - limited cafe listed, limited area. Can be improve with APIs (Google map, Tripadviser) in future for more database. Search tool/dark mode would be nice touch. 

 - Business Rules - Accurate review information is essential. However, it is dealing with personal review, information can be very objective. Make sure all the user aware that the review is come from objective opinion. 



 * Main target user : cafe searcher/business owner/tourist/visiter




### Structure
---

I decided to separate the website into four sections- the home page, cafes, top3, contact pages. Moreover, there are coffee quiz and search form to interacted with user. The navbar and footer (both fixed) allow the user to easily find ways to get in touch and each page is to show a consistency throughout. Each page is designed to provide practical information, reliable linked and related real images and content enough to enable the user to know what the website provides. 




### Skeleton
---

The website is divided into the mainly four section and additional one  each quiz&search form as well as three additional pages on cafe pages by Dublin2,Dublin6,Dublin8. Most of contents are match with my frame work, however, I made many change through the project such as each pages layout and additional pages ( quiz and search form).I added extra framework after . I replace top3page which originally gallery page was. Try to avoid repeating same information in different page. 
 
 #### Wireframes
This website have eight pages. The wireframes do not match with my final projext exactly, however, I can say almost as planed. 
 - Landing Page: welcoming page

### Surface
—--

I wanted keep in consistence all the images and colour in relate to coffee image. Most of images from myself took from actually cafe which I reviewed, colour tones got inspired from Adobe [Adobe color](https://color.adobe.com/search?q=coffee) and [Colorspace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23352E24&sub=1) for colour match. Some illustration work on myself to match colour tone with website. Most of containers and images got border shadows to look more 3D visual effect. 


 #### Design

  - Images : Each of the images were carefully selected to depict the scene and send impression of realism as use really cafe photos. Try to add extra brightness and contrast to make attractive and light up the impression of website overall. 


  - Color Scheme : I wanted make the website as much as minimum colour but have consistent between all the colour combination. Mainly get many colour tone from coffee images and use two site [color space](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23352E24&sub=1) and [Adobe color](https://color.adobe.com/search?q=coffee) to get better colour combination. Main color tone is light brown for container and footer. Dark brown and bright text on nav used for catch users eyes easily. 

![adobe color](assets/docs/images/adobecolor.png)
    -- adobe color

 ![color space](assets/docs/images/colorspace.png)




  - Typography : I used Google Fonts to get some idea of my website fonts and decided to use “ ‘Poppins” and  “Sans-serif” as the back-up font. I choose Poppins because it looks more followed trend as modern and minimalism as same time it looks friendly and reliable. 



  - Icons : Font Awesome was my choose to use all icons on my website. I used mainly footer social icon, top3 page heading icons. Try to use icons that easy to understand purpose of usage. 





## Features
---

### Navbar

 - There are navbar fixed on the top all the webpages to give user better accessibly and navigate the website easily. 

 - Use dark background color and bright text to catch visiter’s eyes easily. On a mobile or table, the navbar is then collapsed to show hamburger icon which expands when clicked to display the other pages. 

 - The user can click on the logo or navbar band to take the user back to the homepage. 

### Home

 - The top of homepage, there are slideshow used ‘ bootstrap4 carousel ’, use 4 different cafe images with welcoming text and real cafe image with cafe name on it.  Try to send message that what this website is about. 

 - Under the slideshow, there are two image with short text come with links. First one is lined with my personal blog that contain all cafe reviews. And second image linked to simple coffee quiz that interacted with user and increase interest about the website. 

 - Under the two image card, there are map ( use google map API).Beside the map there is list of each cafes name written on map. It also linked the review paged on my personal cafe review blog. 

 - Under the map, there is newsletter form that invite the user to sign up to the icoffeemap’s newsletter. 

### cafes (Dublin 2,6,8)

 - when user click the Cafes it shows three option as Dublin2,6,8. When user click the Dublin 2, the pages shows 5 cafes reviews.There are cafes image with moving card contain short review with link button inside image. Use  card hover effect to give better motion on the pages. In Dublin 6, there is two cafe images and same card hover effect. Same effect on Dublin 8 with 5 cafes image. Try to minimised the layout and appearance of pages to give clear idea of website and focus on user interaction with card hover effect. 

### Top3

 - this page is top3 suggestion of different category cafe.  Three cafes are  ranked with my personal opinion.  The purpose of the page is that user can reduce the searching time, instantly decide what they look for. I use simple hover effect when mouse move on each row to give friendly interaction with user.

### Contact

 - simple layout for contact form contain with coffee image and user can send  full name and email address as well as message. The form will be sent to my personal email address ( I used [emailJS](www.emailjs.com) and when user sent the form,  user will get the alert that they have sent the message. 

### Footer

 - footer allocated bottom of each page, So when user finished scroll down, they always expected to see the footer. Footer is contained about which linked the about page on my personal blog explain about the cafe review and beside the about, there are social media links . So they will be help to get extra information about the website and user can find another way to communicate with icoffeemap website. 



## Existing Features
---

There are many existing cafe review website in online. I wanted to create  website that simple and easy to find the info as well as having some fun with it too. My website have two big section as functionally . One is offer cafe information and recommend the cafes. Second is interacting with  user through coffee quiz and search form.  


### HOME

I already mention most of existing feature above paragraph. Additionally, navbar and footer help to navigate whole website and with media query , website has better look and clear appearance. There are no about info shows on footer on mobile size device. It design by that to give simple look for small device. Same information can check on one of image card which is linked to my cafe review blog. 


### CAFES(Dublin 2,6,8 Pages)

same function as home page about navbar and footer. Simple image card hover effect with linked button in it. 


### TOP3

simple image card with linked button on the bottom of image. When user move mouse each row, not chosen image row get less opacity. In that way, website can interact with user. 


### CONTACT

Try that user get reacted after message sent. So, user can be sure that it worked okay. 


### QUESTIONS

There are three questsions with options to choose. after the question, user would get best fit cafes from the choice made. There are cancel options all the form right coner and go next and back as well as finish funtion on them. 

### COFFEEQUIZ

There are four quizs with timer function and progess bar and shows the correct answer with green color and orange color with wrong answer. End of quiz get the percentage of quiz answer result with friendly image and comments. 



## Features left to implement
---

 - There are many function can be improve. For instance, it would be better that there are search bar on the right corer of navbar, so user can easily search regardless cafe name or location. 

 - As increase of popularity and user traffic, it would be good idea to put dark mode that user can easier to read on their device.

 - More cafe lists need to update and exiting cafe review list should be up-to date information to be service as possible as accurate information.

 - Forms testing: 
 
There are two section to form test. First one is getting users information form such as ‘newsletter’ and ‘Contact’. Moreover, there are two quiz form such as ‘Find your cafe( questions)’ and ‘coffee quiz’. To ensure the website was functioning as it should, I tested each of forms on different devices and browsers. 

1. Newsletter
This form is basically asking visiter to sign up for new update as registering their email. There are email input box and send button on the below. When user input their email address, I got the data through my email account which I register on ‘emailjs’ 

    texting form data used the [link](https://www.emailjs.com). Also, after user submit the email, there are confirm popup on window that confirmation message to user that the data sent successfully. 

2. Contact
This form is required three section to filled up to submit and optional message. When user submit the info with submit button, the data come to my registered account and show confirmed message on windows popup. Texting form data used the [link](https://www.emailjs.com).

3. Find your cafe(questions)

User can find the this form button on home page inside carousel. When the button clicked there is new window open and one with start button and three questions boxes and result box at last. This form is contain close button on the right corner of each boxes and options button with ‘Next’’Back’’Finish’ as user can navigate the questions as their desire. Credit to [this link](https://github.com/rudberga/CI-MS2-inspiry-tokyo).

Each button tested and all button works as it was designed for. Originally it supposed popup inside my home page. I made separate page to do the question form. The reason is there are many function on home page inclues slideshow, coffee quiz and map etc.I want to more clear and less traffic on one page.

4.  Coffeequiz

This form is asking user four questions about coffee and shows the score base on the users have tested. There are thirteen buttons all together. First one with start button and three option buttons each with four questions. I tested all and work. The quiz contained with timer and four counters with is working according the code. The result shows with percentage works with counters and the image and comments change according to the percentage. All works.

#### Project bug and solution

  - bug1

![bug1](assets/docs/images/bug/bug1.png)

This bug occured in mobile views. I coudn't figue out the margin issue with footer. Which supposed to fixed on conter in various mobile devices. I got help from tutor and media quary I rid of pull-right from css stlye and add margin 10 auto to make center. The bug fixed.




  - bug2
  
  ![bug2](assets/docs/images/bug/bug2.png)

This bug occured on tablet view. I add min-width 250 and with media quary I add another css to be min-width 200, also adjusted margin size. it got fixed

  - bug3 

  ![bug3](assets/docs/images/bug/bug3.png)

 On question.js, the suggested (model4) was keep shows on bottom of question , I realized that I made mistake on speling (model-split->modal-split). Fixed.

  - bug4

  ![bug4](assets/docs/images/bug/bug4.png)

  On question.js, function didn't work and it show error and I realized that suggestions should be more option to fit the function requirement. Becaues there are  only 12 objects, some of options doesn't fit with suggestion. I add more cafes on suggestions, so function has more flexiblity to run. 


  - bug5

  All the images had big size, it delayed loading time. My montor advised me to compress all the image size. I used [this site]((https://tinyjpg.com/)) to compress all the images and test on my old laptop. it loads faster than before.

2)After get my own repository for my project I start work all coding and update all my files on Gitpod. 

3)Gitpod, a cloud-based version control software or IDE was used to write all code for this project. 

4)Each day when I done, I save the data and when all the work was done, I went to Github pages and check the setting menu and found the Github pages. I selected the Master Branch and it automatically create URL address. 

5)To access the code,, I can get clone which provides an URL and I can use my phone or any device, or download as zip file on the device.  -
